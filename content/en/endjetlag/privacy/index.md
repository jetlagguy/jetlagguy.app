The End Jet Lag app uses the following libraries and services that may collect personal information: <!--more-->

* Aggregated analytics via [Firebase Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics)

* Crash Reporting via [Firebase Crashlytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics)

The End Jet Lag app does not collect any personal information.  Crash reporting libraries such as Crashlytics have the potential to collect personal or private information, but as the app does not collect this, it remains moot.
